# A Programming Language

> **_I never know how a language works before working on this project._**

1. Mainly, this project is using plain JavaScript to write a programming language called Egg or anything you want to call it :), which I think the ideas from here are very very impressive and might very likely be implemented in other places.

2. I ran into this project by reading a book called Eloquent JavaScript and still remember how excited I was when understanding how it runs and thought I must put it on my GitHub. But if any infringement found here, please contact me and I would close and delete this repo as soon as possible.

3. For now, I'm trying to add my thoughts about JavaScript, about languages and maybe all the other things upon the already existing parts but much likely I world fail because it's too good.

Cheers! And great thanks to [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/12_language.html).
